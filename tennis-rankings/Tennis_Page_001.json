It is a remake of the 1999 Resident Evil game Resident Evil 3: Nemesis, and follows former elite agent Jill Valentine and mercenary Carlos Oliveira as they attempt to find a vaccine and escape from a city that has been infected by a viral bioweapon. The game is played from an over-the-shoulder, third-person perspective and requires the player to solve puzzles and defeat opponents while being pursued by a creature called Nemesis.\r\n\r\nMost of Resident Evil 3 was developed concurrently with the 2019 remake of Resident Evil 2 and both games run on Capcom's proprietary RE Engine. Although the game features the same premise as the original, many parts were rearranged in favor of a more focused story. To honor the more action-oriented approach of the original, developers revamped the movement speed and animations from the Resident Evil 2 remake and added an ability for players to dodge incoming attacks. Because some features from the original game were excluded, a separate online multiplayer game, Resident Evil: Resistance, was bundled with Resident Evil 3.",

    "Overview": "Ratchet: Deadlocked (known as Ratchet: Gladiator in Europe, Australia and Africa, and Ratchet & Clank 4 in Japan) is a 2005 action platformer in the Ratchet & Clank series, developed by Insomniac Games and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation 2.\r\n\r\nThe game's story begins as Ratchet, Clank, and Al are abducted and forced to compete in \"DreadZone\", a violent game show in which heroes are forced to kill each other. Ratchet is given a \"DeadLock\" collar, which will explode if he becomes uncooperative or boring. The three must find a way to deactivate the collars and free the other heroes being held prisoner. Deadlocked was the last Ratchet & Clank game to be rated T, despite the introduction of the E10+ rating earlier that year. It's also the last main series Ratchet & Clank game to be released on PlayStation 2.\r\n\r\nThe gameplay is similar to that of other games in the series, but focuses more on shooter aspects rather than platforming. The player, as Ratchet, fights in DreadZone tournaments across the \"Shadow Sector\" in the \"Solana\" Galaxy, with a large variety of weapons. This game was the first in the series to feature cooperative gameplay in a story mode, and also includes an online multiplayer mode. Some vehicles return from previous games, and new ones are introduced. For the first time, Clank (in his typical form) was not a playable character.\r\n\r\nDeadlocked was met with generally favorable reviews, although slightly lower than its predecessors, with some criticism being aimed at its darker tone, repetitive gameplay and level design, and the removal of Clank as a playable character.",
